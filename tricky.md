## Optimization
- caching / hashing of states?

## Quality
- WHY IS IT AVOIDING TAKING MY LAST PIECE?
  - scale king score gain with iteration


Early game: no opening, knight on 2nd row, ...
Mid game: too much pawn pushing, not enough development, no structure
End game: what even is an endgame? Also, king trading ftw.


- better evaluation
  - (e.g. mobility, how many moves possible, how many squares covered?)
  - free pawns
  - pawn progress
  - free pawn progress
  - double up pawns
  - development
    - turrets not locked up in the edges, in the center
    

#### Openings





- threefold repetition


- doesn't consider check while castling
- doesn't consider draws!  It thinks it will lose its king.
