## Optimization
- caching / hashing of states?
- coarse and fine grained (more depth, less initial moves) search?

## Quality
- better evaluation
  - (e.g. mobility, how many moves possible, how many squares covered?)
  - free pawns
  - pawn progress
  - free pawn progress
  - development
    - turrets not locked up in the edges, in the center

#### Openings





- threefold repetition


- doesn't consider check while castling
- doesn't consider draws!  It thinks it will lose its king.
